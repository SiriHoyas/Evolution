# Evolution

Evolution was my exam project for my first year at Noroff. The task was to create a blog covering a subject of my choice. I built my own front end and populated the site with content from a headless CMS (Wordpress).

## Description

For this project I had to add elements that I hadn't tried making before. I used my existing knowledge of Javascript to create the following functions:

- Show more function that fetches more posts from the API.
- A carousel displaying the latest posts, three at a time.
- A category converter for converting WordPress' numbered categories to the appropriate category name.
- A filter function to fetch all posts of a given category.
- A modal to expand the image inside a post
- Posting comments to wordpress.
- Posting the contact form to wordpress.

## Built With

- Wordpress REST API
- Javascript

## Future Plans

While this project works fine, I do have some id√®as for changes I would like to make in the future.
