Evolution was my exam project for my first year at Noroff. The task was to create a blog with a subject of my choice. The site was populated with content from a headless CMS (Wordpress), and built my own front-end.

## Description

For this project i had to add elements that i had never done before. I used my basic knowledge of Javascript to create the following functions:

- Show more function that fetches more posts from the API.
- A carousel displaying the latest posts, three at a time.
- A category converter for converting WordPress` numbered categories to the appropriate category name.
- A filter function to fetch all posts of a category.
- A modal to expand the image inside a post
- Posting comments to wordpress.
- Posting the contact form to wordpress.

## Built With

- Wordpress REST API
- Javascript
